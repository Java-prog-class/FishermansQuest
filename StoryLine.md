FisherMans Story
================

As a young man, the elders of your village often spoke of scary fables about Dragon Island.
They told of a menacing dragon that could demolish everything in it's path.
You listened in awe to the stories of course being an impressionable young man, 
but your curiosity thrived as you got older following, in your father's footsteps of being
a great fisherman.

Many times while you were resting at the market you could hear groups of fisherman telling 
stories of the reefs around Dragon Island.
"Millions of fish as far as the eyes can see my friend!".

As the days grew longer and the nets seemed to get emptier by the day you couldn't 
stop hearing the stories of the reefs replay over and over in your head until one 
day you were so desperate for a good catch that you gave in to your temptation 
and hesitantly steered your boat towards the mysterious fabled island know as Dragon Island!
